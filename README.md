### Install Nodemon
* install Nodemon globally: This package will restart your server whenever there is a code change.

```
> npm install -g nodemon
```   

You use nodemon wherever you would use node so for instance if you wanted to do:   

```js

> node index.js

```

You would do this instead:   

```js
nodemon index.js
```

Now whenever you make a change to your file nodemon will restart the app for you.

### Install other packages

```
> npm install
```
